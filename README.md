# Working-with-BRFFS-and-EIA-Gasolone-Price-Data


For this project, I compiled data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and monthly (BRFSS), state-level, gasoline price data from the US. Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Do files show how to clean, merge and manage raw data to turn it into a functional data set. I collected data for the years 2010 - 2016. Gasoline prices were adjusted to 2016 dollars using CPI and include their respective tax rate.

Finally, econometric analysis was implemented to analyze the influence of gasoline price volatility on several risky behavior outcomes.
